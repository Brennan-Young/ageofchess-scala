# Age of Chess

Age of Chess is a Chess variant that takes inspiration from RTS games like Age of Empires by allowing players to collect resources and spend them on new pieces.  The game was originally developed by my friend Mart as a Windows app and is available here: https://github.com/mart90/AgeOfChess.  This repo makes Age of Chess playable from the browser.
